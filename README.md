# Overview

WeatherLayers consists of two products, that can be used either together or separately:

* [WeatherLayers GL](weatherlayers-gl/) is a frontend visualisation library which can be integrated with common map libraries. The library can be used with either custom self-hosted data or cloud data provided by [WeatherLayers Cloud](weatherlayers-cloud/).
* [WeatherLayers Cloud](weatherlayers-cloud/) is a cloud service providing pre-processed data for visualization from common public weather data sources.
