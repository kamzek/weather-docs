# Overview

WeatherLayers consists of two products, that can be used either together or separately:

* [WeatherLayers GL](weatherlayers-gl/) is a library of high-performance interactive weather visualization layers and controls, which can be customized in real-time and supports integration with major mapping libraries. The library can be used either with custom self-hosted data or with [WeatherLayers Cloud](weatherlayers-cloud/).
